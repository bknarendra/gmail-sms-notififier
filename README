Here I wrote a small utility in java using curl and my youmint api for receving gmail natifications.
It sends you notification on mobile phone as sms when you receive a new mail from a particular user you want to watch.
For configuration purposes there is input.ini file tht you can configure where you specify informtion needed by the program
You can modify it to use other sites for sending sms. I have currently used only youmint to send smses.
Hope  you like it..........
